# Y2-R-Programming
Year 2 Semester 2 - R Programming

For the assignment, you are asked to explore the application of data analytics techniques to the dataset which is provided. You must study data problems related to the dataset, giving special consideration to the unique properties of the problem domain, and testing one or more techniques on it.

Your analysis should be deep and in details, also it must go further than what has already been covered in this course. You must adopt the data Exploration, Manipulation, Transformation and Visualization concepts to guide you through the solution process. It is very important to explain and justify the techniques that have been chosen.

You also may need to pre-process your data to get it into an appropriate format. The assignment should involve a number of techniques by categorize it into different criteria and a detailed exploration with the commands using in each criteria. Outline the findings, analyze them and justify correctly with an appropriate graph. Also, a supporting document is needed to reflect the graph and code using R programming concepts.
